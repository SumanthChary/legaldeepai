## Firefox "LegalDeep AI Risk Inspector" extension

The repository also ships a standalone Firefox browser extension that lets Legal, Sales, and RevOps teams highlight contract language and instantly surface risk signals.

- **Source location:** `extension/firefox/`
- **Key files:**
	- `manifest.json` â€“ WebExtension manifest (Firefox, Manifest V2)
	- `background.js` â€“ registers the "Analyze with LegalDeep AI" context-menu action
	- `riskAnalyzer.js` â€“ shared heuristic engine for scoring risk indicators
	- `contentScript.js` â€“ gathers selected text or full-page content and stores results
	- `popup.html` / `popup.js` / `popup.css` â€“ in-browser dashboard for results and custom text checks

### Install for local testing (temporary load)

1. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦** and choose any file inside `extension/firefox/` (for example `manifest.json`).
3. Visit any page, select contract language, right-click, and choose **Analyze with LegalDeep AI**. The popup updates with the latest score and flagged issues.
4. Use the popup buttons to rerun selection scans, analyze the full page, or paste custom text.

### Package for distribution

```bash
cd extension/firefox
zip -r ../legaldeep-ai-risk-inspector.zip .
```

Submit the generated ZIP through the [Firefox Add-on Developer Hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/) when you're ready to ship.

### Troubleshooting tips

- If the popup shows "Analysis engine unavailable", ensure both `riskAnalyzer.js` and `contentScript.js` are loaded (Firefox logs appear under **about:debugging â†’ Inspect**).
- Large documents are truncated to the first 50k characters for performance; the popup will note when truncation occurs.
- To clear highlighted spans from a previous scan, rerun an analysis or refresh the page.

## E-signature quickstart

The e-signature workflow now mirrors commercial tools while remaining self-hosted. To test it locally:

1. Set the following environment variables (in `.env` or your hosting provider):
	- `RESEND_API_KEY` â€“ transactional email provider for OTP delivery.
	- `ESIGN_EMAIL_FROM` â€“ from address, e.g. `LegalDeep AI <noreply@yourdomain.com>`.
	- `ESIGN_SESSION_SECRET` â€“ 32+ character secret for signer access tokens.
	- `FRONTEND_URL` â€“ base URL for deep links (e.g. `https://legaldeep.ai`).
2. Deploy the new Supabase Edge Functions: `create-signing-session`, `get-signing-session`, `verify-signing-otp`, `complete-signature`.
	```bash
	supabase login                               # once per machine; provide your access token
	supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>    # e.g. nhmhqhhxlcmhufxxifbn
	supabase db push                             # applies migrations, including e-sign upgrades
	supabase functions deploy create-signing-session
	supabase functions deploy get-signing-session
	supabase functions deploy verify-signing-otp
	supabase functions deploy complete-signature
	```
3. Create a signature request from `/esignatures`, add a signer email, and Supabase will email a secure link.
4. Signers visit `/sign/:token`, verify with OTP, draw a signature, and the stamped PDF plus audit trail is stored in the `esignatures` bucket.
